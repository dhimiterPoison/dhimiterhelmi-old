This project is not more on my priority list,


but is the one i started to develop a more entrepreneur mindset so i like this to be here in my portfolio.


After lunch, while working in [Alfa Sistemi](https://dhimiterhelmi.it/career/alfa-sistemi), me and my colleagues always went to get a coffee at the bar,


and they had this phisical card you could buy at the price of 10 coffeesâ€™, the eleventh was free!


and it was a nice idea. some other bars had similar approachs to this, some others didnâ€™t at all.


after forgetting my card multiple times in the office, one day, i started thinking that a digital version of the card would be great.

- you always have it in your pocket (even multiple ones),
- you could pay for it online without waiting for the queue in front of you,
- aand there was room for bars to stand out with a â€˜discover near youâ€™ feature.
- also having a digital platform could have given the possibility to have analytics under control when and where you want (without having to check the orders notebook ðŸ«£â€¦ imagine counting all the active cards.. disaster)


I wasnâ€™t sure of the business model and didnâ€™t think that could be profitable at all for me.

	nonetheless i started working on it, it would have been a good exercise anyway.
	
	not much time passes and i just had a mockup on Figma and some pages templates in React,


	when i get involved in the [Balonade project](https://dhimiterhelmi.it/project/balonade), and the priority shifted to that, being:

	1. urgent
	2. would have seen the production for sure

	after that i decided to work on my little big space on the internet where to showcase my projects,


	even in the prospect of a new job opportunity in the Netherlands. I already had this idea to move here in mind,


	and yeah.


	Here we are.


	Now i am working on [Self, your life at a glance](https://dhimiterhelmi.it/project/self-glance)
