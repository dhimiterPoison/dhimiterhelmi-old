Best things happen casually.


I was helping some friends organizing the <u>Buttrio</u> 's summer sport torunament (Balonade), and we were discussing about how to manage teams subriptions.


First idea was to build a form, but being honest, the result was a bit <u>clumsy</u>.


Example of the form mentioned earlier


Then I realized that, as a Frontend developer with a considerate eye for UX, i couldn't live with that. If I was a user and had to enroll the tournament using that form, i would have gone crazy.


Situation:

1. Not much time
2. First time to launch something in production on my own
3. Didn't know what tech stack to use

GAAADAMIT (Why do i love putting myself in this situations)


After some research, I decided to use the following tech stack:


| Experience | Name         |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| **New**    | Next JS      |
| **2y exp** | React        |
| **New**    | Tailwind CSS |
| **New**    | Xata.io      |
| **New**    | UploadThing  |


### Sketching time


Focus points:

- One
- Two
- Three
- -- Image ui sketch ---

I asked for some feedback from the organizing body and they were really hyped.


I had my green light to start building.


### Love and hate


Nextjs seemed a great choice in order to build and deploy both frontend and backend at light speed.


After a few tutorials, and some Bestemmie, i realized that they had just released the 13th version, and the tutorials were<u>**outdated**</u>**.**


Ookay, never mind. I got it. After that i really loved NextJs and it Developer experience.


Also its <u>documentation</u> is really well explained and easy to follow.
