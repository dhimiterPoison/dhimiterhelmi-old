title: Self, your life at a glance

---

Focus your energies on what truly matters and stay in the flow!


Store your thoughts, ideas, and feelings in a **safe** place and let
_Self_ help you organizing your time and energies.


You probably want to do a lot of things, but fitting a thousand of activities in one day won’t fullfill you.


It is better to focus in less things or smaller chuncks of the main activity so you can reach your goal step by step.


Every piece will come together eventually, showing up every day with some more knowledge and muscle memory.


You’re getting out of your _comfort_ zone and it’s normal to have to put more **intention** into our daily lives to make it to the point where that feels normal and you execute your routine with _**ease**_ and little energy expense.


The work you do now will give you fruits later,


but remember:
you do it for the joy and excitement that it brings to you now, not for the outcome.


have you ever used to Journal? writing your thoughts daily and freeing up your brain from pending/unresolved things or thoughts.


For sure this practice has helped a lot of people, me included


but i think we can get even more through it.


	> I love the feeling of the paper and the sound of my fountain pen interacting with it, but:   
	> it’s hard sometimes to go back and put together pieces of the same topic in order to have a good outlook on our mind and thoughts.


Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to talk with an empowered version of ourselves? 


thats why we gave birth to _**Self,**_ 


and it is here to help you in this journey as a tool that people can use to create _**systems**_ that can really <u>**benefit their lives**</u>**.**


To do that, your Self gets to know your core values and aspirations through your journal.


You dump your thoughts daily in the way it’s most comfortable for you:

- through voice
- with a video recording
- writing digitally on your keyboard

or (and we know you will love it)

- scanning your handwritten notes in your paper journal.

unlock your full potential, building routines combining the activities you _**care**_ the most with the ones you _**need**_ the most.



Do you often complain about that toothache but you actually never book the appointment with te dentist?
Self will prioritize that task for you.



Are you spending too much time doing only work, work, work and work again and then you have no energy to enjoy your days?


Self will highlight that,
suggesting you to take breaks, maybe have a bath or prepare the grocery list for you,


so you can prepare that _risotto with gamberetti and zucchine_ that you really enjoy.


Do you want to learn spending money more consciously?
Self has you covered.


Track your expenses and add items you desire to buy in a shopping cart.


Self will prioritize this list based on the alignment between your core values, your needs and your economic situation.


The goal?
Help you do the work.


Help you finish the tasks you set in your mind and then you maybe get lost.


Help you show up and enjoy the process of creating a life aligned with your values.


Tailored exercises will help you expand your perception and consider different points of view.


_**Self**_ is still under developement,
