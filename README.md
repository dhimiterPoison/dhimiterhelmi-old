i will rewrite the portfolio, check out the new repo.

i started building this portfolio when i was a fullstack developer working for a company, didnt really have a clue about showcasing my value, worth or whatever.
now that i founded my own company and am working on freelance projects,
i realize that i need a different/better presentation to the potential customers/or even companies.

I also want it to have a more professional look and feel. i was trying to just make the changes in this repo but i realize that having rewritten some pieces many times theres some mess and its prob better to just start from a clean point. letsgo.

checkout the new repo for the new code and development.
